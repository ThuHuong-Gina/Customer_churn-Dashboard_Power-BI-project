## I. Overview

- Power BI dashboards can serve as a valuable tool for gaining insights into an organization's sales performance and identifying trends.
  
- The dashboard should encompass essential metrics like overall sales, product-specific sales, geographical sales distribution, customer segment analysis, and product category breakdown.
  
- Additionally, it should facilitate year-over-year performance comparisons and enable users to explore specific markets and products in greater detail through drill-down capabilities.

### I.1. Business question

- Senior executives seek access to business data to formulate strategies for market expansion and make informed decisions regarding strategic product selections.
  
- Develop a dashboard that offers insights and recommendations drawn from the data analysis, assisting stakeholders in addressing the challenges they encounter.

## IV. Insights

- The company has experienced a consistent increase in sales volume over the years.
- Among customer categories, consumer customers generate the highest sales volume, followed by corporate customers, with home office customers having the lowest sales volume.
- Technology flooring products are the top-selling category, followed by furniture, and office supplies, with a marginal difference compared to furniture.
- Sales volumes typically peak during the final two months of the year and dip at the beginning of the new year.
- The Technology product line yields the highest profits.
- In terms of transportation, the highest quantity transported pertains to the product line associated with the home office customer group.
- Transportation costs primarily focus on the standard class, although the first class also accounts for a significant portion.

## V. Recommendations

- The technology segment, which is the top-performing in terms of sales, also leads in generating the highest profits. It's advisable to prioritize this product line.
- The home office customer group, although it generates lower sales, stands out for the highest number of deliveries. Therefore, there should be a focus on offering tailored packages for this customer group to minimize order returns and boost sales.
- The consumer and corporate customer groups collectively contribute to almost 80% of both sales and profits. Hence, it's crucial to concentrate efforts on these two groups by implementing strategies such as promotional campaigns and targeted email marketing.
