# SuperStore-Dashboard_Power-BI-project

Power BI dashboards offer valuable assistance in delivering comprehensive sales performance and organizational trend insights. 
The dashboard should encompass crucial metrics like overall sales, product-specific sales, sales based on different locations, sales by customer segments, and sales categorized by product types. 
Furthermore, it should facilitate comparisons of performance with previous years and allow users to explore detailed information for individual markets and products through drill-down functionality.
